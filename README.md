# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.  This also utilises jquery and third party APIs.

The project shows the current date on the top of the page and current business hour as well as past and future hours, within this time period, using colour.  It saves inputs into local storage so it can be retrieved later when the site is refreshed.  The project also allows the user to clear all the fields so it is no longer saved in local storage.  A prompt has been added to help prevent accidental clear All's.

## Installation

## Usage
