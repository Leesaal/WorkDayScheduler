# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.  This also utilises jquery and third party APIs.

The project shows the current business hour as well as past and future hours, within this time period, using colour.  It saves inputs into local storage so it can be retrieved later when the site is refreshed.  The project also allows the user to clear all the fields so it is no longer saved in local storage.  A prompt has been added to help prevent accidental clear All's.

## Installation

## Usage

This code can be used to log different events/tasks to do at different times of the day.  Also helps identify, through the use of colour, the current hour if the time is during business hours.

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
